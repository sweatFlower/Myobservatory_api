"# Myobservatory_api" 
I'm glad you came to visit my project, let me give you a guide. The framework of API testing consists of five partsï¼š
 1.api: there are interfaces of the system under test.
 2.data: there are data of test cases, when we write data driven tests, we can put the data prepared in this directory.
 3.report: the allure generates the test report in here.
 4.scripts: we write the test cases in here.
 5.utils: we encapsulate some methods that we commonly use.
This framework is simple and flexible, and it also integrates well with Jenkins.
